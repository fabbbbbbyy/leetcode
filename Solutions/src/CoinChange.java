/**
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change/
 *
 * Problem:
 * You are given an integer array coins representing coins of different denominations and an integer amount
 * representing a total amount of money.
 * Return the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up
 * by any combination of the coins, return -1.
 *
 * You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.
 *
 * Insight: Sorting input might help to maintain invariants, even for DP problems.
 * When using Integer.MAX_VALUE as a flag and addition is possibly needed, remember to use 1L instead of 1
 * before comparison in case of integer overflow.
